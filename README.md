# DungeonMaster
This code will find the shortest path in a given RxC grid, the cells which cannot be traveresed are marked with "#" and the end cell is marked with "E".
The inputs to store the untraversable cells and the end node can be given in the main function.
The number of cells in the shortest path are printed out in the last.
The code uses BFS and Queue data structure to find out the traversable cells.
